# Configuration file for LeakSanitizer run on the Travis CI, Qt-specific.

# Qt4 leaks stuff from some internal QString functions (8 allocations, 476
# bytes every time)
leak:libQtCore.so

# Since 2018-01-09 (some Travis update?) there's a leak of 2032 bytes from
# calloc(). I have no idea what this is. Can't reproduce locally. Because this
# matches practically half of everything, I can't have this suppression
# globally.
leak:calloc

# Since 2018-06-02 (or maybe sooner, because there was a DevIL leak that
# prevented this from being visible) there are more leaks coming, maybe(?) also
# related to the plugin being loaded through dlopen() now. Since this plugin is
# on its way to deprecation, I don't bother.
